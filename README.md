## Pokedex

That's my first project with React by myself, and I am very excited about this one.
I'm put in practice, states, events, life-cycle,components, props, etc. Until now I'm having a lot of fun with React, pretty good library, the dom manipulation with react is way more simple and faster. In this project I'm using PokeAPI, a RESTful API with a huge set of information about Pokemon <br />
